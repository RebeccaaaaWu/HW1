# HW1
Lab 1 is about how to use the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) module to perform basic text analysis. 

NLTK is a Python add-on package which has multiple useful functions for analyzing text files. One key component of text analysis is finding keyword frequency distributions.

A frequency distribution can be shown as a table containing how many times within a document different words appear. 
To directly quote the NLTK book, “it’s called a "distribution" because it tells us how the total number of word tokens in the text are distributed across the vocabulary items. Since we often need frequency distributions in language processing, 
NLTK provides built-in support for them” (http://www.nltk.org/book/ch01.html). 

Lab1 contains contents below:
1. String Manipulation 
2. tokenization 
3. stop words removal
