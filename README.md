Analyze and draw insight and conclusions from the dataset
births.xlsx provided to you. The data was collected and published by New York City. It is limited to NY
city. The dataset is real but may not be complete as we do not know if all births are registered.
births.xlsx Description: Baby Names by Sex and Ethnic Group: Data was collected through civil birth
registration. Each row (record) shows the summary for a specific name given to newborn babies. The
same name may be given to several babies in a year, across the years, and ethnic groups.
• Example:
Birth year gender ethnicity First name frequency
2011 female hispanic geraldine 13
• The above record shows that the name “geraldine” was given to 13 newborn female babies of
Hispanic ethnicity in 2011. Ethnicity is derived from mother’s ethnicity.
• The same name may have been given to babies of a different ethnicity or in a different year.
• All the text data in the columns is converted to lower case. That is why you see geraldine, instead of
Geraldine.
